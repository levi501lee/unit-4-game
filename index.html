<h1>Shiny Stone Stealing Game</h1>

Listen my young talib, this is a smash and grab. Check your pocket lint
dollars below because you need to get Alfonso his green. 
Except you aint got much green, but you got a guy that sells loose stones on
the street corner. Time to start snatching! 

Problem is, you don't know how much each stone is worth until you lift it!
Luckily for you, each specific stone is the same price once you do know it.

Each game the price will be different!
 The amount of money you start with will be different
 The amount you owe Alfonso will be different

 Not get to it and steal those shiny stones!
